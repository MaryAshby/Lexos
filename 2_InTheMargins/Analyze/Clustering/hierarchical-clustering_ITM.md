The Lexos **Hierarchical Clustering** tool performs hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis on your active documents and produces a visualization of this analysis in the form of a dendrogram (tree diagram). The most important options are the **Distance Metric** (method of measuring the distance between documents) and **Linkage Method** (method of determining when documents will be attached to a cluster) dropdown menus. Lexos uses Euclidean distance and average linkage as defaults. For further details about how to choose a distance metric and linkage method, see the topics discussion on [Hierarchical Clustering](hierarchical-clustering).

The remaining options allow you to configure the appearance of the dendrogram. You may supply a **Dendrogram Title**, which will be displayed at the top of the graph and select the **Dendrogram Orientation** (vertical or horizontal). In our experience, vertically-oriented dendrograms are easier to interpret. However, when they have many leaves, the labels tend to overlap and become unreadable. Horizontal dendrograms may produce slightly better results. Another approach is to limit the **Number of Leaves** displayed in the dendrogram. Reducing this number will collapse the most closely related clusters (those lower down on the dendrogram), showing only the larger groups. A numbered label in parentheses will show how many leaves have been collapsed into single branch. See below for other strategies for producing more readable dendrograms.

The **Show Branch Height in Dendrogram** option will place red nodes at the top of each clade labelled with the height (length) of the clade branches from the leaf node. See the [How to Read a Dendrogram](how-to-read-a-dendrogram) video for the interpretation of branch height. The **Show Legends in Dendrogram** will add to the dendrogram image a series of annotations showing the options you have selected.

All of the [Advanced Options](advanced-options) for manipulating the Document-Term Matrix (DTM) are available in the **Hierarchical Clustering** tool. There are also options for generating a _Silhouette Score_,  measure of determining cluster robustness. **Silhouette Score Options** are discussed below.

**Important**: Due to a limitation in the scipy [clustering package](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html) employed by Lexos to plot dendrograms, leaf labels containing non-Roman or other special characters will most likely appear as question marks. If this is the case, we recommend using the [Advanced Options](advanced-options) **Temporary Labels** function to ensure that your leaf labels clearly identify your documents. We hope to address this limitation in future versions of _Lexos_.

Once you have selected your options, click the **Get Dendrogram** button. After the dendrogram appears, you can click on it top open it in a new window.

### Silhouette Scores
Silhouette scores give a general indication of how well individual objects lie within their cluster and are thus one method of [measuring cluster robustness](establishing-robust-clusters). A score of 1 indicates tight, distinct clusters. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.

To generate a silhouette score for your dendrogram, click on the **Silhouette Score Options** menu. You may set the **Maximum Number of Clusters** to between 2 and the number of active documents in our session. After setting this number, click the green **Get Dendrogram** button, and the silhouette score will appear above the button. Further information can be found in the topics article on [Silhouette Scores](silhouette-scores).

### Downloading Dendrograms
Lexos allows you to download dendrogram images in a number of formats (PDF, PNG, and SVG). To download dendrogram image, click the appropriate button on the right side of the screen.

Lexos uses the scipy [clustering package](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html) to plot dendrograms, and this has some severe limitations in the type of output available. There are many other tools available which allow you to explore and manipulate dendrograms once you have done your cluster analysis. These tools typically allow you to import pre-existing dendrogram (tree) structure in [Newick format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format): a text file representing the hierarchical structure using parentheses and commas. Lexos also provides **Newick** download button which will convert your dendrogram's structure to a text file in Newick format. You can then upload this file in external tools. Note, however, that many external dendrogram plotting tools do not seem to preserve branch height.
