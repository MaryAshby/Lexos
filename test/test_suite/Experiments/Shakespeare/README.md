Shakespeare
=====================================================================

This experiment uses Lexos for authorship attribution.

Shakespeare is a legendary Elizabethan playwright, but he has been confirmed
to have collaborated for some of his work. In particular, _Henry VI_ is now
jointly attributed to William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, a contemporary
of the Bard.

Here, we will use Lexos to show the collaborative relationship between
Shakespeare and Marlowe, using _Henry VI_.

Using the tools from:   http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu
and the files found in the FilesToUse/ directory, you should be able to
produce a dendrogram and a K-Means cluster as shown in ResultsToExpect/.
