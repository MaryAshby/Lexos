    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default orientation for the dendrogram is left. Click this button
        to see the other orientation options. Click "Generate" to see your changes
        reflected in the graph.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Tokenize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default Lexos tokenizes by tokens, meaning it splits strings of text
        into tokens every time it encounters a space character. For Western languages,
        this means that each token generally corresponds to a word. To tokenize
        by multiple words, you can increase the n-gram size.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example given the text: "the dog ran" tokenizing by 1-gram tokens
        would produce tokens "the", "dog", "ran". Tokenizing by 2-grams would
        count the instances of bi-grams or pairs of words, thus producing tokens
        "the dog", "dog ran", and so on.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you wish to tokenize by characters, Lexos will treat every character
        (letters, whitespace, punctuation, etc.) as a separate token. Tokenizing
        by 2-gram characters would produce tokens "th","he","e ", and so on.
        Tokenizing by characters is best used for non-western languages that don't
        have whitespace between tokens such as classical Chinese.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Normalize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default "Normalize" setting is "Proportional" which displays the
        frequency of the occurrence of terms in your documents as a proportion
        of the entire text.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Raw Counts" will display in the table the actual number of occurrences
        of each term in each document.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "TF-IDF" or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency attempts to
        take into account difference in the lengths of your documents by
        calculating their TF-IDF. This options allows you to chose the distance
        metric according to which each document vector is normalized. Lexos
        uses base<em>e</em> (natural log) as the default. Lexos offers three
        different methods of calculating TF-IDF based on Euclidean Distance,
        Manhattan Distance, or without using a distance metric (Norm: None).
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cull</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Culling" is a generic term we use for methods of decreasing the number
        of terms used to generate the DTM based on statistical criteria (as
        opposed to something like applying a stop-word list in Scrubber). Culling
        is optional to use in Lexos. Lexos offers two different methods:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Use the top ___ words": This method takes a slice of the DTM
        containing only the top N most frequently occurring terms in the
        set of active documents. The default setting is 100, meaning
        Tokenizer will generate the DTM using only the top 100 most
        frequent terms.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Must be in ___ documents": This method build the DTM using only
        terms that occur in at least N documents. The default setting is
        1. If you have 10 active documents and you want to generate the
        DTM using only terms that appear in all your active documents,
        set the value to 10. <em><b>Note:</b> You can quickly determine
        the number of active documents in your workspace as indicated by
        the counter in the bottom right corner.</em>

    <li><b>Plotly Menu</b></li>

    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you pan over the graph, you'll notice that a menu appears in the top
        right corner.
        <ul class="help-section-list">

            <li>Camera icon: This option will download the graph as a <code>.png</code>
            image.</li>

            <li>Zoom: This option allows you to click and drag to zoom in to a
            specific part of the graph.</li>

            <li>Pan: This option will change the click and drag function to
            panning across the graph.</li>

            <li>Zoom in and Zoom out: These will automatically zoom to the center
            of the graph.</li>

            <li>Auto-scale and Reset Axis: These options will zoom all the way out
            with the axis reset to fit the window</li>

            <li>Toggle spike lines: This option allows you to hover your mouse
            over data points and see where they are aligned on the x-axis and
            y-axis</li>

            <li>Show closest data on hover: If you hover over a data point,
            this option will show you the value of the data point.</li>

            <li>Compare data on hover: If you hover over a data point, this
            option will show you the value of the data point and it's corresponding
            x-axis value.</li>
