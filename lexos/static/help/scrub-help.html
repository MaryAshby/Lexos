<h3 class="help-section-title">The Scrubber Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Pre-processing your texts, what we refer to as "scrubbing", is a critical
    step when probing digitized texts and is a primary step in the Lexos workflow.
    In order to facilitate a conscious consideration of the many small decisions
    required, scrubbing options are isolated into individual choices. If for
    no other reason, your careful deliberation and choice of the many options
    during scrubbing facilitates replication of your analyses in the future,
    both by you and others who wish to replicate your experimental results.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    <b>Scrubbing affects all active documents and cannot be undone.</b>
    So make sure to de-activate any documents you do not wish to scrub using
    the <u><a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/manage">Manage</a></u>
    tool. If you apply scrubbing and later wish to revert to the un-scrubbed
    version, you will have to upload another copy to Lexos.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Preview and Apply</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Preview" button allows you to view your options without
        permanently saving the changes. At this point, only the beginning and
        end of each document is displayed, separated by ellipses (â€¦). When
        you are satisfied that you have achieved the desired effect, click the
        "Apply" button. Your documents will be scrubbed, and the scrubbed
        versions will be used by all the other Lexos tools.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Download" button allows you to download the scrubbed versions of
        your files. A <code>.zip</code> folder of your scrubbed versions will
        be downloaded. Downloading scrubbed files can facilitate future analyses
        by uploading the previous scrubbed versions, allowing you to skip the
        scrubbing step and ensuring that your analyses are based on the
        same scrubbing options.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Remove <u><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a></u> boilerplate material</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you have uploaded a file from the Project Gutenberg website without
        removing the boilerplate material (i.e., text added by the
        Project Gutenberg site at the top and license material at the end of
        the text), you will receive a warning. <br><br>
        If you select the "Apply" button without removing
        this extra text, Lexos will attempt to remove the Project Gutenberg
        boilerplate material at the top and end of the file. However, we
        suggest you remove the boilerplate material using a text editor before
        uploading it to Lexos in order to prevent unwanted text from being
        included in subsequent analyses (e.g. including Project Gutenberg
        licensure material in your word counts.) due to the inconsistency of the boilerplate format.
