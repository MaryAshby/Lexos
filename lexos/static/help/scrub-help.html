<h3 class="help-section-title">The Scrubber Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Pre-processing your texts, what we refer to as "scrubbing", is a critical
    step when probing digitized texts and is a primary step in the Lexos workflow.
    In order to facilitate a conscious consideration of the many small decisions
    required, scrubbing options are isolated into individual choices. If for
    no other reason, your careful deliberation and choice of the many options
    during scrubbing facilitates replication of your analyses in the future,
    both by you and others who wish to replicate your experimental results.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    <b>Scrubbing affects all active documents and cannot be undone.</b>
    So make sure to de-activate any documents you do not wish to scrub using
    the <u><a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/manage">Manage</a></u>
    tool. If you apply scrubbing and later wish to revert to the un-scrubbed
    version, you will have to upload another copy to Lexos.

<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Preview and Apply</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Preview" button allows you to view your options without
        permanently saving the changes. At this point, only the beginning and
        end of each document is displayed, separated by ellipses (…). When
        you are satisfied that you have achieved the desired effect, click the
        "Apply" button. Your documents will be scrubbed, and the scrubbed
        versions will be used by all the other Lexos tools.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Download" button allows you to download the scrubbed versions of
        your files. A <code>.zip</code> folder of your scrubbed versions will
        be downloaded. Downloading scrubbed files can facilitate future analyses
        by uploading the previous scrubbed versions, allowing you to skip the
        scrubbing step and ensuring that your analyses are based on the
        same scrubbing options.

<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Remove <u><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a></u> boilerplate material</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you have uploaded a file from the Project Gutenberg website without
        removing the boilerplate material (i.e., text added by the
        Project Gutenberg site at the top and license material at the end of
        the text), you will receive a warning. <br><br>
        If you select the "Apply" button without removing
        this extra text, Lexos will attempt to remove the Project Gutenberg
        boilerplate material at the top and end of the file. However, we
        suggest you remove the boilerplate material using a text editor before
        uploading it to Lexos in order to prevent unwanted text from being
        included in subsequent analyses (e.g. including Project Gutenberg
        licensure material in your word counts) due to the inconsistency of the boilerplate format.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Make Lowercase</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase characters so that the
        tokens "The" and "the" will be considered as the same term. In addition,
        all contents (whether in uploaded files or entered manually) for the
        Stop Words/Keep Words, Lemmas, Consolidations, or Special Characters
        options will also have all uppercase characters changed to lowercase.
        Lowercase is not applied inside any <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>,
        or <code>SGML</code> markup tags remaining in the text.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Remove Digits</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Removes all number characters from the text. Similar to the handling of
        punctuation marks, any Unicode character in each of the active texts
        with a “Number Character Property” is removed. For example, this option
        will remove a Chinese three (㈢) and Eastern Arabic six (۶) from the tex
        t. Note: at present, Lexos does not match Real numbers as a unit.
        For example, for 3.14, Lexos will remove (only) the 3, 1, and 4 and the
        decimal point will be removed only if the Remove All Punctuation option
        is selected. Remove Digits is not applied inside any <code>HTML</code>,
        <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code> markup tags remaining in the text.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Remove Whitespace</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Remove Spaces: each blank space will be removed.</li>
            <li>Remove Tabs: each tab character <code>\t</code> wil be removed.</li>
            <li>Remove Line Break: each newline character <code>\n</code> and carriage return
            character <code>\r</code>  will be removed.</li>
        </ul>
        Remove Whitespace is not applied inside any <code>HTML</code>,
        <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code> markup tags remaining in the text.
        <br><br>
        Removing whitespace characters may be useful when you are working with
        languages such as Chinese that do not use whitespace for word boundaries.
        In addition, this option may be desired when tokenizing by character
        n-grams if you do not want spaces to be part of your n-grams. See the
        section on Tokenization for further discussion on tokenizing by character n-grams
    </h3>

    <li><b>Scrub Tags</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Handles markup tags in angular brackets, such as those used in
        <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code>. In markup
        languages like these, start and end tags like
        <code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code> are used to designate an “element”.
        Elements may be modified by “attributes” specified inside the start tag.
        For instance, a text using the the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
        specification for XML might contain the markup
        <code>&lt;p rend=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        for a paragraph in italics. <br><br>
        When "Scrub Tags" is selected, you may click "[Options]" to open the
        tag scrubbing dialog. This will allow you to choose one of four options
        to handle each type of tag or to handle all the tags at once:
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Remove Tag: Removes the start and end tags but keeps the content in between.</li>
            <li>Remove All: Removes the start and end tags and all the content in between.</li>
            <li>Repalce: Replaces the start and end tags as well as all of the content between
                with whatever you place in the "Replacement" text field. </li>
            <li>None: This option will leave the specified element untouched in the text.
                This is especially useful if you want to scrub other markup tags. </li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
