<!-- The Manage Tool -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">The Manage Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Manage is the tool you use to perform various types of "housekeeping" on
    documents in your Lexos workspace. In addition to documents derived from files
    you have uploaded, Manage will also list documents created by other tools such
    as segments produced by the <u><a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/cut">Cutter</a></u> tool.
</h3>

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><b>Purposes</b></li>
<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">Activate and de-activate documents in your
    workspace (Lexos tools only operate on your active documents). Delete unwanted
    documents from your workspace. Re-name documents in your workspace. Add
    class labels to your documents in your workspace (e.g. apply an AUTHOR class
    label to all documents with the same author).
</h3>

    <li><b>Columns in the Document Table</b></li>
<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Documents in your workspace are listed in the form of a table. The left-most
    column indicates what documents are active.
    <br><br>The "Document" column lists the
    filename without the filename extension. The original filenames are listed
    in the "Source" column. If you use Lexos tools to create new documents
    based on your uploaded files (e.g., if you segment a document), the original
    filename will be displayed in the "Source" column, and a new name will
    be generated for the "Document" column. Document names can be changed using
    the context menu, as described below.
    <br><br>By default, documents created by file upload or a Lexos tool do not have an
    associated class, so the "Class" column is empty.
    <br><br>The "Excerpt" column shows
    a preview of the beginning of each document.
    <br><br>Rows in the table can be sorted by column information by clicking on the column header
    (see the arrow in the column header to indicate the sorting order, e.g.,
    increasing or decreasing order).

<!-- Activating, de-activating, and deleting documents -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">
    Activating, De-Activating, and Deleting Documents
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    By default, all documents are activated when they are uploaded. In subsequent
    analyses, only active documents are used. (Note: return here to the Manage
    page to ensure all desired documents are active. Rows containing active
    documents are highlighted in green. The following methods can be used to
    manage the active state of documents:
</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list">
    <li>
        Single Click: This will de-activate all documents and toggle the state of the
        row clicked. If it is active, it will be de-activated. If it is not active, it
        will be activated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Control or Command Click: This will toggle the state of the row clicked
        without affecting the state of any other rows.
    </li>
    <li>
    Shift Click: This activate ranges of rows. Shift-clicking on a row will
    activate documents in all rows between the row clicked and the first active
    row above or below the row clicked.
    </li>
    <li>
    Drag Click: Clicking on a row with the mouse button held down will activate
    or de-activate all rows between the row clicked and the row the mouse cursor
    is over when the mouse button is released.
    </li>
    <li>
    Right Click: This will open the context menu. See Using the Context Menu
    below.
    </li>
    <li>
    The Select All and Deselect All Buttons: These are useful because they
    activate and de-activate all the documents in your workspace, not just those
    displayed on the page.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Documents may also be activated and de-activated using the Context Menu as
    described below.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Certain tools such as Word Cloud allow you to select and de-select sub-sets of
    your active documents. These selections apply only within the given tool and
    do not affect whether the documents are active or not throughout the Lexos
    suite. If you need to change the state of a document so that it is or is not
    accessible to all tools, you should do this using Manage.
</h3>


<!-- Deleting documents -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Deleting Documents</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Deleting individual documents from the workspace is probably achieved most
    easily achieved using the Context Menu as described below. However, you can
    deselect all documents, activate only the document you wish to delete, and
    then click the Delete Selected button. This button is probably more useful
    when you have multiple active documents, as it will delete them all at once.
    Make sure that you have de-activated any documents you do not wish to delete.
</h3>


<!-- Using the context menu -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Using the Context Menu</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Right-clicking on a table cell or row will open the context menu. It has the
    following options:
</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list">
    <li>
    Preview Document: This will open a dialog containing the entire text of your
    document (without formatting or white spaces). Note that longer documents can
    take a while to load, so please be patient.
    </li>
    <li>
    Edit Document Name: This function allows you to create a new name for the
    document in the row you have clicked. To change the name, enter your new name
    in the dialog form field and click Save.
    </li>
    <li>
    Edit Document Class: This function allows you to create a class label for the
    single document in the row you have clicked. Enter the label you wish to
    identify with the class in the dialog form field and click Save. See further
    the section on document classes below.
    </li>
    <li>
    Delete Document: This function will delete the individual document in the row
    you have clicked.
    </li>
    <li>
    Select All Documents and Deselect All Documents: These options have the same
    function as the Select All and Deselect All buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
    Apply Class to Selected Documents: If you have multiple active documents, this
    option will allow you to apply a class label to all of them at once. Enter the
    label you wish to identify with the class in the dialog form field and click
    Save. For example, you might apply an AUTHOR name (class label) to all
    documents from a particular author. See further the section on document
    classes below.
    </li>
    <li>
    Delete Selected Documents: If you have multiple active documents, this option
    will allow you to delete them all at once. It has the same function as the
    Delete Selected button.
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- Classifying documents -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Classifying Documents</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Document classes are groups of documents identified as belonging to the same
    category defined by some human-assigned criterion. For instance, a collection
    of novels might be separated into two classes based on whether they were
    published in Britain or the United States. Gender, genre,  date of authorship,
    and authorship might  be used to classify documents. Lexos' class labels allow
    you to assign classes to documents and sort by class in the Manage tool.
    At present, document classes are under-utilized elsewhere in the Lexos suite;
    however,  they are an important part of the Topwords tool. In general, you
    should assign class labels in Manage before using Topwords.
