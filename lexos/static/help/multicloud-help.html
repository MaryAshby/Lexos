<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    See the <u>Word Cloud</u> tool to learn about what a word cloud is and how
    Lexos generates them. The Lexos Multicloud tool allows you to use word clouds
    to generate a comparative visualization of your documents. Each document has
    a separate word cloud, displayed in a grid that allows you to “eyeball”
    similarities and differences between the proportions of terms in each document.
</h3>

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    All active documents will be used to generate the multiclouds. Please
    keep in mind that generating multiclouds is computationally intensive
    and may take a very long time if you are generating a large number of
    clouds. Your browser may hang for some time. Please be patient.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Because the word clouds are necessarily small, they may not always be easy
    to interpret. If you find interesting documents using the Multicloud tool, it is
    recommended that you also generate larger clouds of each individual document
    using the <u>Word Cloud</u> tool. Before returning to the Word Cloud tool
    to investigate a single document, make sure it is the only active document.

    Davies’ word cloud generator offers some useful ways to modify the layout
    using the controls below the graph. After modifying the settings, you can
    re-generate the word cloud by clicking anywhere on the graph. Each of the
    settings is described in detail below:

    <li><b>Font</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can change the appearance of your word cloud by setting the font
        here. This feature should work with any font installed on your system.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Number of Words</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos includes the top 250 terms in your documents. Use
        this setting to modify the number. Limiting the number of terms may help
        you to include high frequency terms which are dropped by the layout algorithm.

        The Multicloud tool does not yet have an export function, so the best
        way to save the Multicloud display is with a screen shot. Some screen
        capture programs such as <a target="_blank" href="http://getfireshot.com/"><u>Fireshot</u></a>
        allow you to capture the entire page, rather than just the visible area,
        which will allow you to save an image of all the multiclouds. In Mac OSX,
        you can click <code>Command+Option+F</code> for full screen followed by
        <code>Command+Option+3</code> or <code>Command+Option+4</code> .
