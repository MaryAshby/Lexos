    The Lexos Cutter tool allows you to divide your texts into multiple segments.
    Each segment is treated by Lexos exactly like any other document. You can
    perform individual scrubbing actions, create word clouds of segments, and
    cluster the segments of documents just as you would any other text.

    <li><b>Preview and Apply</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Once you have selected the cutting options you desire, click the "Preview"
        button to see the results in the preview window. If you are happy with
        the cuts performed by Lexos, click the "Apply" button. This will create
        new documents with the same name as the original followed by a number
        for each segment. Each segment will appear as a new document in the
        <u><a href="http://lexos3.wheatoncollege.edu/manage">Manage</a></u>
        tool. Once cutting is applied, the original document is de-activated
        and the new segments are made active documents.

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can download the new document segments by clicking the "Download"
        button. This is handy when you want to work with your segmented documents
        again but you want to begin by uploading your previous segmented documents,
        thus allowing you to skip the cutting step.
