<h3 class="help-section-title">The Word Cloud Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Word clouds are a method of visualizing the Document-Term Matrix. They
    present terms arranged at angles for compactness, with each term sized according
    to its frequency within the text. Word clouds enable you to get a sense of
    the content in your corpus, and they are very good for presentations. However,
    they also have some well-known limitations. In some languages, individual
    tokens may not correspond to words, which will limit the usefulness of this
    method of visualization.

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Word Cloud tool uses Jason Davies’ excellent
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/"><u>word cloud generator for d3.js</u></a>
    — with a few modifications— to create beautiful, interactive word clouds.
    This implementation scales the size to ensure all terms fit within the layout.
    The color used for each does not convey meaning and is used only for aesthetic
    purposes.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Lexos generates a word cloud using all your active documents. If you would
    like a word cloud for each of your documents, use the <a href="/multicloud"><u>Multicloud</u></a> tool.
    A word cloud will automatically be generated when you open the tool, but
    there are changes you can make to modify the visualization. <em><b>Note:</b>
    Large documents can take a while to generate so please be patient. </em>

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Davies’ word cloud generator offers some useful ways to modify the layout
    using the controls below the graph. After modifying the settings, you can
    re-generate the word cloud by clicking anywhere on the graph. Each of the
    settings is described in detail below:
</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Font</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can change the appearance of your word cloud by setting the font
        here. This feature should work with any font installed on your system.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Number of Words</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos includes the top 250 terms in your documents. Use
        this setting to modify the number. Limiting the number of terms may help
        you to include high frequency terms which are dropped by the layout algorithm.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Word clouds are downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or <code>.png</code>
        format. SVG images are very useful because they scale well in web browsers.
        If you click the SVG button, a new window will open with a copy of your
        word cloud. Use your browser’s "Save as…" function to save the web page.
        If you click the PNG button, the image will open in a new window.
        The procedure for saving a PNG image is not standard in all browsers,
        so follow the instructions you see on the screen.
