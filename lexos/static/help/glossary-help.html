    This page is intended to provide definitions for the terms used within the
    Lexos suite, as well as to disambiguate terms drawn from natural language,
    programming languages, and linguistic analysis. New entries are being added
    on an ongoing basis.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering is a method of bottom-up analysis
        wherein each document is its own cluster, after which the clusters are
        merged to form one cluster for all documents.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Average Linkage</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Also called UPGMA, this linkage is an un-weighted hybrid of complete and single linkages.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Bray-Curtis Distance</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is a standardized form of Manhattan distance.
        Not metric itself, it is instead the proportion of values not shared between
        points, or, equivalently, the sum of absolute differences over the sum
        of all instances. Points further from the origin have more impact on
        the percentage.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Canberra Distance</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Canberra distance is a weighted version of the Manhattan distance. Instead
        of the sum of differences, it measures the sum of the difference ratios.
        The weighting allows this metric to be very sensitive to differences
        between points near the origin.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Character</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        A character is any individual symbol. The letters that make up the Roman
        alphabet are characters, as are non-alphabetic symbols such as the Hanzi
        used in Chinese writing. In Lexos, the term character generally refers
        to countable symbols.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Chebyshev Distance</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Chebyshev distance ignores all but the greatest component difference
        between two vectors. It is similar to Euclidean and Manhattan distances,
        in that instead of infinite (continuous) or square-grid (orthogonal)
        movement, it allows 8 directions of freedom (orthogonal and diagonal).
        It is used reliably in very niche circumstances.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Complete Linkage</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Also called the ‘farthest neighbour’ algorithm, this linkage produces
        spherical clusters of similar diameter.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Correlation Distance</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Correlation distance is equivalent to Cosine distance after vectors have
        been shifted by their means. Correlation distance metrics perform well
        in very high dimensions with few null values.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cosine Distance</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Cosine distance is the measure of the angle formed by two vectors from
        the origin; it only judges the orientation of points in space, not their
        magnitudes. This metric is related to Euclidean distance by factoring
        dot products. Cosine distance is best for working in very high dimensions,
        especially if there are many null values in the vectors.
